# Introduction to Exploiting

## What is the Stack?

- Like a stack of plates. First in, First out. The most recently added element will be the first to be "popped"
- There is a pointer (a variable that holds an address) that keeps track of the most recent "pushed" element
- When you enter a function, a base pointer is added to the stack, which keep track of the function you are currently in.
- A new function will allocate space on the stack that can be used for the function. 
Example:
```
void func() {
  int number = 20;
  String str = "Hello";
  arr = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
}
```
```
----------------------
|         6          | <- Stack pointer
----------------------
|         5          |
----------------------
|         4          |
----------------------
|         3          |
----------------------
|         2          |
----------------------
|   Address of str   |
----------------------
|        20          |
----------------------
|   Base Pointer     |
----------------------
|   Return Pointer   |
