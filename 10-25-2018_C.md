## Pointers
A variable that holds a memory address
```int *numAddr;``` Creates an integer pointer

```char *myString;``` Creates a pointer for character, which can be used as a string

```char myOtherString[]``` Creates an array of characters, and in arrays pointer

Integer pointer will give you 4 bytes for the address and the value

Dereferencing gets the information from the pointer.

## Using pointers
Creating a pointer 
```int *myNum;```

Accessing the value of the pointer
```*myNum = 10 //Set the value of myNum to ten```

---

Create an integer
```int myNum2;```

Accessing the address of the the integer
```&myNum2 = myAddres //Set the address of myNum2 to myAddress```

##argv

argv holds the command inputted when running a C program
```argv``` in the main method is a double pointer because it is an array of strings, and strings are arrays of characters.

argv[0] is the relative path of the command
argv[n] is the nth word in the command

For example:
In the command: ```./helloworld Hello World```

> argv[0] = "./helloworld" 

> argv[1] = "Hello"

> argv[2] = "World"
